Write a function that reverses a string. The input string is given as an array of characters s.

You must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.

Input: s = ["h","e","l","l","o"]
Output: ["o","l","l","e","h"]

CODE:
class Solution {
    public void reverseString(char[] s) {
        int length = s.length;
        for (int i = 0; i < length / 2; i++) {
            char temp = s[i];
            s[i] = s[length - 1 - i];
            s[length - 1 - i] = temp;
        }
    }
}
