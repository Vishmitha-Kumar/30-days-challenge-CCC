Guess number high or low
We are playing the Guess Game. The game is as follows:

I pick a number from 1 to n. You have to guess which number I picked.

Every time you guess wrong, I will tell you whether the number I picked is higher or lower than your guess.

Input: n = 10, pick = 6
Output: 6

CODE:
/** 
 * Forward declaration of guess API.
 * @param  num   your guess
 * @return 	     -1 if num is higher than the picked number
 *			      1 if num is lower than the picked number
 *               otherwise return 0
 * int guess(int num);

            int mid=s+(e-s)/2;
            int guessNumber=guess(mid);

            if(guessNumber==-1)

            }
            else if(guessNumber==1)
