CODE CHEF:

For encoding an even-length binary string into a sequence of A, T, C, and G, we iterate from left to right and replace the characters as follows:

00 is replaced with A
01 is replaced with T
10 is replaced with C
11 is replaced with G
Given a binary string 
 
S of length 
 
N (
 
N is even), find the encoded sequence.

Input Format
First line will contain 
 
T, number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
Each test case contains two lines of input.
First line contains a single integer 
 
N, the length of the sequence.
Second line contains binary string 
 
S of length 
 
N.
Output Format
For each test case, output in a single line the encoded sequence.

Note: Output is case-sensitive.

DAY:2
There are 

N buns in the mall, and each member of the family needs to eat 

X buns everyday to survive.
After the food supply runs out, the family can survive for a further 

D days.

How many days can Alice and family survive under these conditions?

DAY 3:
All of Chef's friends are playing fantasy cricket based upon the ODI World Cup, and Chef would like to join them.
Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer 
T, denoting the number of test cases.
The first and the only line of each testcase contains a single integer 
N, the number of players Chef is considering.
Output Format
For each test case, output on a new line the number of possible choices of captain and vice-captain.
